# Cognitive Agent Learning and Adaptation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive cognitive agent learning and adaptation capabilities for PyCog-Zero, fulfilling the medium-term roadmap requirement (Month 2-3) for cognitive agent learning and adaptation capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. CognitiveLearningTool (`python/tools/cognitive_learning.py`)

The core tool for adaptive learning and behavior modification with the following capabilities:

**Learning Experience Management:**
- Records learning experiences with context, actions, outcomes, and success scores
- Stores experiences in a circular buffer (default: 1000 experiences)
- Supports different learning types: experiential, reinforcement, observational

**Behavioral Pattern Recognition:**
- Automatically identifies successful behavioral patterns from experience data
- Tracks pattern success rates, confidence levels, and usage counts
- Updates patterns using exponential moving averages for adaptation

**Adaptation and Improvement:**
- Analyzes performance trends and learning velocity
- Generates adaptation strategies based on learned patterns
- Provides improvement recommendations based on performance analysis

**Knowledge Transfer:**
- Export/import learned behavioral patterns between agent instances
- Enables knowledge sharing and collaborative learning

### 2. Enhanced Behavior Adjustment (`python/tools/behaviour_adjustment.py`)

Enhanced version of the existing behavior adjustment tool with learning integration:

**Learning-Enhanced Adjustments:**
- Integrates recommendations from cognitive learning system
- Classifies adjustment types (error correction, performance improvement, etc.)
- Records behavior adjustments as learning experiences

### 3. Enhanced Meta-Cognition (`python/tools/meta_cognition.py`)

Extended meta-cognition tool with learning assessment capabilities:

**Learning Assessment:**
- Evaluates learning capacity and meta-learning capabilities
- Tracks learning velocity and behavioral pattern formation
- Provides enhanced adaptation indicators

## Usage Examples

### Recording Learning Experiences

```python
# Record a successful experience
await learning_tool.execute("record_experience",
    context={"type": "problem_solving", "domain": "mathematics"},
    action="systematic_approach",
    outcome={"result": "success", "time": 120},
    success_score=0.85,
    feedback="Good systematic approach"
)
```

### Analyzing Learning Progress

```python
# Analyze learning over the past 24 hours
analysis = await learning_tool.execute("analyze_learning", period_hours=24)
# Returns performance trends, learning velocity, pattern counts
```

### Behavioral Adaptation

```python
# Adapt behavior for a specific context
adaptation = await learning_tool.execute("adapt_behavior",
    context={"type": "communication", "domain": "user_interaction"},
    force=True
)
# Returns adaptation strategy with preferred actions and confidence
```

### Knowledge Transfer

```python
# Export learned patterns
await learning_tool.execute("export_learned_patterns", 
    file_path="/path/to/patterns.json")

# Import patterns from another agent
await learning_tool.execute("import_learned_patterns",
    file_path="/path/to/patterns.json",
    merge_mode=True
)
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### OpenCog Integration
- Stores learning experiences as atoms in OpenCog AtomSpace (when available)
- Integrates with ECAN for attention allocation based on learning events
- Graceful fallback when OpenCog is not available

### ECAN Attention Management
- Requests attention for high-success learning experiences
- Registers with centralized ECAN coordinator
- Priority-based attention allocation for learning events

### Agent-Zero Tool Framework
- Follows standard Agent-Zero tool patterns and interfaces
- Compatible with existing tool ecosystem
- Supports tool chaining and cross-tool integration

## Performance Characteristics

### Learning Velocity Calculation
- Measures improvement rate per experience over time
- Uses trend slope analysis for performance assessment
- Supports adaptive thresholds for different learning contexts

### Pattern Recognition Efficiency
- O(1) experience insertion with circular buffer
- Indexed retrieval by context type for fast pattern matching
- Confidence-based pattern filtering

### Memory Management
- Configurable experience buffer sizes
- Automatic cleanup of old experiences
- Compressed pattern storage with usage statistics

## Testing and Validation

The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite (`test_cognitive_learning_adaptation.py`) that validates:

1. **Basic Learning Cycle** - Experience recording and analysis
2. **Behavioral Adaptation** - Pattern-based behavior modification
3. **Meta-Cognitive Integration** - Learning assessment enhancement
4. **Behavior Adjustment Enhancement** - Learning-enhanced behavior adjustment
