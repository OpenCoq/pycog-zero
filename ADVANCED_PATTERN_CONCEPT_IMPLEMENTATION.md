# Advanced Pattern Recognition and Concept Learning Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive advanced pattern recognition and concept learning capabilities for PyCog-Zero, fulfilling the long-term roadmap requirement (Month 3+) for "Advanced pattern recognition and concept learning."

## Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Pattern Recognition Tool (`advanced_pattern_recognition.py`)

#### Hierarchical Pattern Detection
- **Multi-level abstraction**: Detects patterns at multiple abstraction levels (0-5)
- **Frequency-based patterns**: Identifies recurring elements with configurable thresholds
- **Pattern grouping**: Groups similar patterns for higher-level abstraction
- **Confidence scoring**: Calculates pattern reliability based on frequency and cohesion

#### Temporal Pattern Recognition
- **Recurring sequences**: Detects repeating n-gram sequences in temporal data
- **Periodic patterns**: Identifies periodic behaviors using autocorrelation analysis
- **Causal patterns**: Discovers "A leads to B" relationships with confidence measures
- **Temporal context**: Maintains sequence memory for pattern prediction

#### Analogical Reasoning
- **Structural analogies**: Maps structural similarities between domains
- **Relational analogies**: Finds common relationship patterns (A:B :: C:D)
- **Functional analogies**: Compares purposes and functions across domains
- **Domain mapping**: Creates cross-domain concept mappings

#### Advanced Features
- **Pattern transfer learning**: Transfer patterns between cognitive domains
- **Pattern querying**: Search patterns by type, confidence, abstraction level
- **Meta-pattern recognition**: Patterns of patterns for complex reasoning
- **OpenCog integration**: Stores patterns as atoms when available

### 2. Concept Learning Tool (`concept_learning.py`)

#### Concept Formation Engine
- **Instance clustering**: Groups similar instances using feature similarity
- **Prototype generation**: Creates concept prototypes from cluster centroids
- **Boundary definition**: Establishes fuzzy concept boundaries in feature space
- **Automatic naming**: Generates meaningful concept names from common features

#### Concept Refinement Engine
- **Adaptive learning**: Refines concepts based on new evidence and feedback
- **Boundary adjustment**: Expands/contracts concept boundaries based on confidence
- **Confidence updating**: Updates concept reliability based on usage patterns
- **Experience integration**: Incorporates new instances into existing concepts

#### Concept Similarity Engine
- **Feature similarity**: Computes similarity based on prototype features
- **Structural similarity**: Compares feature ranges and distributions
- **Functional similarity**: Evaluates similarity in usage and purpose
- **Combined metrics**: Integrates multiple similarity measures

#### Advanced Capabilities
- **Hierarchical concepts**: Supports parent-child concept relationships
